# Collaboraid

By Gauri Laxman, Melodee Li, Eric Maynard, and Aria Paradkar

This project was created at Pennapps 2018 at University of Pennsylvania.

Often when a disaster occurs in an area, it is difficult for those in need of medical resources or attention to get the help they need. Emergency call centers are backed up, doctors have trouble reaching patients due to destroyed or flooded roads, and there are not enough supplies for the amount of hurt/sick people. We believed that if these people had some way to quickly communicate with a doctor and receive medical advice in a high-stress situation, many injuries could be resolved or at least brought to stable condition before proper supplies and physical doctors arrive.

CollaborAid is an Android app that allows people in disaster areas in need of medical advice to communicate with doctors all over the world. Users would submit a medical case with information like a description, level of urgency, and a picture. Preregistered doctors for the app (who have been properly verified of their medical training and credentials) would then be able to access a list of all the cases and communicate with these people in need.

This app was primarily written in Java in Android Studio. We used Firebase to store and retrieve the medical cases that are made.
